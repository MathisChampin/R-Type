# R-Type Project

This repository contains the structure for an R-Type project with a **client** and a **server**, each in its own directory. The project uses CMake to manage configuration and compilation.

### Step 1: Create a build directory

To keep your repository clean, create a dedicated directory for building:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
